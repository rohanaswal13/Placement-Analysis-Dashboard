# Placement Analysis Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of branch-wise placement trends using DAX queries, Power Query, and data transformation techniques. It visualizes key metrics such as placement percentage, company preferences, and salary distribution to offer meaningful insights.

The project involved data cleaning, applying Power Query for transformations, and using DAX for custom calculations to enhance analysis. Interactive visualizations were designed to help students and institutions understand hiring patterns, identify top recruiters, and compare placement statistics across branches. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for decision-making and trend analysis in campus placements.
